# kpro

`kpro` is a small CLI to help you quickly search for and destroy processes.

## Installation

```bash
// using npm
npm install -g kpro

// using yarn
yarn global add kpro
```

## Usage

Use `kpro` to search and destroy processes. By default it will let you confirm
whether or not you wish to destroy a process.

```bash
kpro <search term>
```

Run in `--force` mode to skip confirmations

```bash
kpro <search term> -f
```
